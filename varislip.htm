Manufacturers of electric motors
have for many years
been faced with the problem that their motors can only run at certain
almost <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/genpoles.htm#syncspeed">
fixed speeds </a> determined by the number of poles in the
motor. As we learned on the previous
page, the motor (or generator) <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/async.htm#slip">
slip </a>
in an asynchronous (induction) machine is usually very small for
reasons of efficiency, so the rotational speed will vary with around 1
per cent between idle and full load. The slip, however is a function
of the (DC) resistance (measured in ohms) in the rotor windings of the
generator. The higher resistance, the higher the slip. so one way of
varying the slip is to vary the resistance in the rotor. In this way
one may increase generator slip to e.g. 10 per cent. On motors, this is usually done by
having a wound rotor, i.e. a rotor with copper wire windings which are
connected in a <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/stat/unitac3c.htm"> star ,</a>
and connected with external variable resistors, plus an electronic
control system to operate the resistors. The connection has usually
been done with brushes and slip rings, which is a clear drawback over
the elegantly simple technical design of an cage wound rotor machine.
It also introduces parts which wear down in the generator, and thus the
generator requires extra maintenance.<br>

Opti Slip&reg;<br>
      <br>

      </span> An interesting variation of the
variable slip induction generator
avoids the problem of introducing slip rings, brushes, external
resistors, and maintenance altogether. By mounting the external
resistors on the rotor itself, and mounting the electronic control
system on the rotor as well, you still have the problem of how to
communicate the amount of slip you need to the rotor. This
communication can be done very elegantly, however, using optical fibre
communications, and sending the signal across to the rotor electronics
each time it passes a stationary optical fibre.<br>

Running a Pitch Controlled Turbine at Variable Speed<br>
      <br>

      </span> As mentioned on the next page,
there are a number of advantages of being able to run a wind turbine at
variable speed. One good reason for wanting to be
able to run a turbine partially at variable speed is the fact that <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/powerreg.htm">
pitch control </a>
(controlling the torque in order not to overload the gearbox and
generator by pitching the wind turbine blades) is a mechanical process.
This means that the reaction time for the pitch mechanism becomes a
critical factor in turbine design. If you have a variable slip
generator, however, you may start increasing its slip once you are
close to the rated power of the turbine. The control strategy applied
in a widely used Danish turbine design is to run the generator at half
of its maximum slip when the turbine is operating near the rated power.
When a wind gust occurs, the control mechanism signals to increase
generator slip to allow the rotor to run a bit faster while the pitch
mechanism begins to cope with the situation by pitching the blades more
out of the wind. Once the pitch mechanism has done its work, the slip
is decreased again. In case the wind suddenly drops, the process is
applied in reverse. Although these concepts may sound
simple, it is quite a technical challenge to ensure that the two power
control mechanisms co-operate efficiently.<br>

Improving
Power Quality<br>
      <br>
      </span>
You may protest that running a
generator at high slip releases more
heat from the generator, which runs less efficiently. That is not a
problem in itself, however, since the only alternative is to waste the
excess wind energy by pitching the rotor blades out of the wind. One of the real benefits of using
the control strategy mentioned here is that you get a better power
quality, since the fluctuations in power output are "eaten up" or
"topped up" by varying the generator slip and storing or releasing part
of the energy as rotational energy in the wind turbine rotor. <br>
