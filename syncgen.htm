In the picture to the left we have installed three electromagnets
around a circle. Each of the three magnets is connected to its own
phase in the <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/stat/unitsac3.htm">
three phase electrical grid. </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>As
you can see, each of the
three <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/stat/emag/emagn.htm">
electromagnets </a>
alternate between producing a South pole and a North pole towards the
centre. The letters are shown in black when the magnetism is strong,
and in light grey when the magnetism is weak. The fluctuation in
magnetism corresponds exactly to the fluctuation in voltage of each
phase. When one phase is at its peak, the other two have the current
running in the opposite direction, at half the voltage. Since the
timing of current in the three magnets is one third of a cycle apart,
the magnetic field will make one complete revolution per cycle. </td>

The compass needle (with the
North pole painted red) will follow the
magnetic field exactly, and make one revolution per cycle. With a 50 Hz
grid, the needle will make 50 revolutions per second, i.e. 50 times 60
= 3000 rpm (revolutions per minute). In the picture above, we
have in
fact managed to build what is called a 2-pole permanent magnet
synchronous motor. The reason why it is called a synchronous motor, is
that the magnet in the centre will rotate at a constant speed which is
synchronous with (running exactly like the cycle in) the rotation of
the magnetic field. The reason why it is called
a
2-pole motor is that it has one North and one South pole. It may look
like three poles to you, but in fact the compass needle feels the pull
from the sum of the magnetic fields around its own magnetic field. So,
if the magnet at the top is a strong South pole, the two magnets at the
bottom will add up to a strong North pole. The reason why it is called
a
permanent magnet motor is that the compass needle in the centre is a
permanent magnet, not an electromagnet. (You could make a real motor by
replacing the compass needle by a powerful permanent magnet, or an
electromagnet which maintains its magnetism through a coil (wound
around an iron core) which is fed with direct current). The setup with the three
electromagnets is called the stator in the motor,
because this part of the motor remains static (in the same place). The
compass needle in the centre is called the rotor, obviously because it
rotates.</span><br>

Operation</span><br>

            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
If you start forcing the
magnet around (instead of letting the current
from the grid move it), you will discover that it works like a
generator, sending alternating current back into the grid. (You should
have a more powerful magnet to produce much electricity). The more
force (torque) you apply, the more electricity you generate, but the
generator will still run at the same speed dictated by the frequency of
the electrical grid. You may disconnect the
generator
completely from the grid, and start your own private 3-phase
electricity grid, hooking your lamps up to the three coils around the
electromagnets. (Remember the principle of </span><a style="font-weight: normal;" href="http://www.windpower.org/en/stat/emag/induct1.htm">
magnetic / electrical induction </a><span style="font-weight: normal;">
from the reference manual section of this web site). If you disconnect
the generator from the main grid, however, you will have to crank it at
a constant rotational speed in order to produce alternating current
with a constant frequency. Consequently, with this type of generator
you will normally want to use an </span><a style="font-weight: normal;" href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/indirect.htm">
indirect grid connection </a><span style="font-weight: normal;"> of the generator. In practice, permanent magnet
synchronous generators are not used very
much. There are several reasons for this. One reason is that permanent
magnets tend to become demagnetised by working in the powerful magnetic
fields inside a generator. Another reason is that powerful magnets
(made of rare earth metals, e.g. Neodynium) are quite expensive, even
if prices have dropped lately.</span><br>

            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
Wind turbines which use
synchronous generators normally use
electromagnets in the rotor which are fed by direct current from the
electrical grid. Since the grid supplies alternating current, they
first have to convert alternating current to direct current before
sending it into the coil windings around the electromagnets in the
rotor. The rotor electromagnets are
connected to the current by using brushes and slip rings on the axle
(shaft) of the generator.</span> </div>
