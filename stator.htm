                  <div class="br0"> You may be thinking
that a stator with twice as many
magnets would be twice as expensive, but that is not really the case.
Generators (and motors) are usually made with a very large number of
stator magnets anyway, as you see in the picture. (We have not yet
added the stator coil windings on the iron). The reason for this
stator
arrangement is that we wish to minimise the air gap between the rotor
and the stator. At the the same time we need to provide cooling of the
magnets. The stator iron in reality consists of a large number of thin
(0.5 mm) insulated steel sheets which are stacked to form the stator
iron. This layering is done to prevent current eddies in the stator
iron from decreasing the efficiency of the generator.<br>

The problem of providing more generator poles on an
asynchronous cage wound generator then really boils down to connecting
the neighbouring magnets differently: Either we take a bunch of magnets
at a time, connecting them to the same phase as we move around the
stator, or else we change to the next phase every time we get to the
next magnet. </div>

Generators<br>
            <br>

            </span> Some manufacturers fit their
turbines with two generators, a small one
for periods of low winds, and a large one for periods of high winds. A more common design on
newer
machines is pole changing generators, i.e. generators which (depending
on how their stator magnets are connected) may run with a different
number of poles, and thus a different rotational speed. Some electrical generators
are
custom built as two-in-one, i.e. they are able to run as e.g. either
400 kW or 2000 kW generators, and at two different speeds. This design
has become ever more widespread throughout the industry. Whether it is worthwhile to
use a double generator or a higher number of poles for low winds
depends on the local <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wres/weibull.htm">
wind speed distribution ,</a>
and the extra cost of the pole changing generator compared to the price
the turbine owner gets for the electricity. (You should keep in mind
that the energy content of low winds is very small). A good reason for having a
dual
generator system, however, is that you may run your turbine at a lower
rotational speed at low wind speeds. This is both more efficient
(aerodynamically), and it means less <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/env/sound.htm"> noise
            </a> from the rotor blades (which is usually only a
problem at low wind speeds). Incidentally, you may have a
few pole changing motors in your house
without even knowing it: Washing machines which can also spin dry
clothes usually have pole changing motors which are able to run at low
speed for washing and at high speed for spinning. Similarly, exhaust
fans in your kitchen may be built for two or three different speeds.
(In the latter case with a variable speed fan, you can use what you
have learned about <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wres/enrspeed.htm">
the energy in the wind </a>:
If you want to move twice as much air out of your house per minute
using the same fan, it will cost you eight times as much electricity). </td>
