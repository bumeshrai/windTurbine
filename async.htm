Wind Turbine Generators.</a>
Most wind turbines in the world use a so-called three phase
asynchronous (cage wound) generator, also called an induction generator
to generate alternating current. This type of generator is not widely
used outside the wind turbine industry, and in small hydropower units,
but the world has a lot of experience in dealing with it anyway: </td>

            <td>
The curious thing about this
type of generator is
that it was really originally designed as an electric motor. In fact,
one third of the world's electricity consumption is used for running
induction motors driving machinery in factories, pumps, fans,
compressors, elevators, and other applications where you need to
convert electrical energy to mechanical energy. One reason for choosing this
type
of generator is that it is very reliable, and tends to be comparatively
inexpensive. The generator also has some mechanical properties which
are useful for wind turbines. (Generator <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/async.htm#slip">

The Cage Rotor<br>

                  <br>

                  </span>it is the rotor that makes the
asynchronous generator different from the synchronous generator. The
rotor consists of a
number of copper or aluminium bars which are connected electrically by
aluminium end rings.
In the picture at the
top of the
page you see how the rotor is provided with an "iron" core, using a
stack of thin insulated steel laminations, with holes punched for the
conducting aluminium bars. The rotor is placed in the middle of the
stator, which in this case, once again, is a 4-pole stator which is
directly connected to the three phases of the electrical grid. </td>

                  </span> When the current is connected, the machine will start turning like a
motor at a speed which is just slightly below the synchronous speed of
the rotating magnetic field from the stator. Now, what is happening?<br>

If we look at the
rotor bars from above (in the
picture to the right) we have a magnetic field which moves relative to
the rotor. This induces a very strong current in the rotor bars which
offer very little resistance to the current, since they are short
circuited by the end rings. The rotor then develops its own
magnetic poles, which in turn become dragged along by the
electromagnetic force from the rotating magnetic field in the stator. </td>

Generator Operation<br>
      <br>

      </span> Now, what happens if we manually
crank this rotor around at exactly the
synchronous speed of the generator, e.g. 1500 rpm (revolutions per
minute), as we saw for the 4-pole synchronous generator on the previous
page? The answer is: Nothing. Since the magnetic field rotates at
exactly the same speed as the rotor, we see no induction phenomena in
the rotor, and it will not interact with the stator. But what if we increase speed
above 1500 rpm? In that case the rotor moves faster than the rotating
magnetic field from the stator, which means that once again the stator
induces a strong current in the rotor. The harder you crank the rotor,
the more power will be transferred as an electromagnetic force to the
stator, and in turn converted to electricity which is fed into the
electrical grid.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Generator Slip<br>
      <br>
      </span>

The speed of the asynchronous
generator will vary with the turning
force (moment, or torque) applied to it. In practice, the difference
between the rotational speed at peak power and at idle is very small,
about 1 per cent. This difference in per cent of the <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/genpoles.htm#syncspeed">
synchronous speed ,</a>
is called the generator's slip. Thus a 4-pole generator will run idle
at 1500 rpm if it is attached to a grid with a 50 Hz current. If the
generator is producing at its maximum power, it will be running at 1515
rpm. It is a very useful mechanical
property that the generator will increase or decrease its speed
slightly if the torque varies. This means that there will be less tear
and wear on the gearbox. (Lower peak torque). This is one of the most
important reasons for using an asynchronous generator rather than a
synchronous generator on a wind turbine which is directly connected to
the electrical grid.<br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Automatic Pole Adjustment of the Rotor<br>
      <br>
      </span>

Did you notice that we did not
specify the number of poles in the
stator when we described the rotor? The clever thing about the cage
rotor is that it adapts itself to the number of poles in the stator
automatically. The same rotor can therefore be used with a wide variety
of pole numbers.<br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Grid Connection Required<br>
      <br>

      </span> On the page about the <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/syncgen.htm">
permanent magnet synchronous generator </a> we showed that it
could run as a generator without connection to the public grid. An
asynchronous generator is different, because it requires the stator to
be magnetised from the grid before it works. You can run an asynchronous
generator in a stand alone system, however,
if it is provided with capacitors which supply the necessary
magnetisation current. It also requires that there be some remanence in
the rotor iron, i.e. some leftover magnetism when you start the
turbine. Otherwise you will need a battery and power electronics, or a
small diesel generator to start the system). </td>
