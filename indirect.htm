Generating Alternating Current (AC)
at Variable Frequency</span> <br>
      <br>
Most wind turbines run at almost
constant speed with direct grid
connection. With indirect grid connection, however, the wind turbine
generator runs in its own, separate mini AC-grid, as illustrated in the
graphic. This grid is controlled electronically (using an inverter), so
that the frequency of the alternating current in the <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/syncgen.htm#stator">
stator </a>
of the generator may be varied. In this way it is possible to run the
turbine at variable rotational speed. Thus the turbine will generate
alternating current at exactly the variable frequency applied to the
stator. The generator may be either a <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/syncgen.htm">
synchronous generator </a> or an <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/async.htm">
asynchronous generator ,</a> and the turbine may have a <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/powtrain.htm">
gearbox ,</a> as in the image above, or run without a gearbox if
the generator has many poles, as explained on the next page. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conversion to Direct Current (DC)</span><br>
      <br>
AC current with a variable
frequency cannot be handled by the public
electrical grid. We therefore start by rectifying it, i.e. we convert
it into direct current, DC. The conversion from variable frequency AC
to DC can be done using thyristors or large power transistors. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conversion to Fixed Frequency AC</span> <br>
      <br>
We then convert the (fluctuating)
direct current to an alternating
current (using an inverter) with exactly the same frequency as the
public electrical grid. This conversion to AC in the inverter can also
be done using either thyristors or transistors. Thyristors or power transistors
are large semiconductor switches that operate without mechanical parts.
The kind of alternating current one gets out of an inverter looks quite
ugly at first sight - nothing like the smooth sinusoidal curve we
learned about when studying <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/stat/unitsac.htm">
alternating current.</a> Instead, we get a series of sudden jumps
in the voltage and current, as you saw in the animation above. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Filtering the AC</span> <br>
      <br>
The rectangular shaped waves can be
smoothed out, however, using
appropriate inductances and capacitors, in a so-called AC filter
mechanism. The somewhat jagged appearance of the voltage does not
disappear completely, however, as explained below. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advantages of Indirect Grid
Connection:</span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;Variable Speed The advantage of indirect grid
connection is that it is possible to run the wind turbine at variable
speed. The primary advantage is that gusts
of wind can be allowed to make the
rotor turn faster, thus storing part of the excess energy as rotational
energy until the gust is over. Obviously, this requires an intelligent
control strategy, since we have to be able to differentiate between
gusts and higher wind speed in general. Thus it is possible to reduce
the peak torque (reducing wear on the gearbox and generator), and we
may also reduce the <a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/design/index.htm#anchor989446">
fatigue loads </a> on the tower and rotor blades. The secondary advantage is that
with power electronics one may control
reactive power (i.e. the phase shifting of current relative to voltage
in the AC grid), so as to improve the power quality in the electrical
grid. This may be useful, particularly if a turbine is running on a
weak electrical grid. Theoretically, variable speed may
also give a slight advantage in terms of annual production, since it is
possible to run the machine at an optimal rotational speed, depending
on the wind speed. From an economic point of view that advantage is so
small, however, that it is hardly worth mentioning. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disadvantages of Indirect Grid
Connection</span> <br>
      <br>
The basic disadvantage of indirect
grid connection is cost. As we just
learned, the turbine will need a rectifier and two inverters, one to
control the stator current, and another to generate the output current.
Presently, it seems that the cost of power electronics exceeds the
gains to be made in building lighter turbines, but that may change as
the cost of power electronics decreases. Looking at operating
statistics from wind turbines using power electronics (published by the
the German ISET Institute), it also seems that availability rates for
these machines tend to be somewhat lower than conventional machines,
due to failures in the power electronics. Other disadvantages are the
energy lost in the AC-DC-AC conversion process, and the fact that power
electronics may introduce harmonic distortion of the alternating
current in the electrical grid, thus reducing power quality. The
problem of harmonic distortion arises because the filtering process
mentioned above is not perfect, and it may leave some "overtones"
(multiples of the grid frequency) in the output current. </td>
