Electronic Wind Turbine Controller</span><br>

            <br>

The wind turbine controller consists of a number of
computers which continuously monitor the condition of the wind turbine
and collect statistics on its operation. As the name implies, the
controller also controls a large number of switches, hydraulic pumps,
valves, and motors within the wind turbine.
As wind turbine sizes
increase to
megawatt machines, it becomes even more important that they have a high
availability rate, i.e. that they function reliably all the time. </td>

Communicating with the
Outside World </span><br>
            <br>
The controller communicates
with the owner or operator of the wind
turbine via a communications link, e.g. sending alarms or requests for
service over the telephone or a radio link. It is also possible to call
the wind turbine to collect statistics, and check its present status.
In wind parks one of the turbines will usually be equipped with a PC
from which it is possible to control and collect data from the rest of
the wind turbines in the park. This PC can be called over a telephone
line or a radio link. </td>

Communications</span><br>

            <br>

There is usually a controller both at the bottom of the tower and in
the nacelle. On recent wind turbine models, the communication between
the controllers is usually done using fibre optics. The image to the
right shows a fibre optics communications unit. On some recent models,
there is a third controller placed in the hub of the rotor. That unit
usually communicates with the nacelle unit using serial communications
through a cable connected with slip rings and brushes on the main shaft.</td>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Fail Safe Mechanisms and Redundancy</span>

      <br>
      <br>
Computers and sensors are usually
duplicated (redundant) in all safety
or operation sensitive areas of newer, large machines. The controller
continuously compares the readings from measurements throughout the
wind turbine to ensure that both the sensors and the computers
themselves are OK. The picture at the top of the page shows the
controller of a megawatt machine, and has two central computers. (We
removed the cover on one of the two computers to show the electronics).

      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What is Monitored?</span> <br>
      <br>
It is possible to monitor or set
somewhere between 100 and 500
parameter values in a modern wind turbine. The controller may e.g.
check the rotational speed of the rotor, the generator, its voltage and
current. In addition, lightning strikes and their charge may be
registered. Furthermore measurements may be made of of outside air
temperature, temperature in the electronic cabinets, oil temperature in
the gearbox, the temperature of the generator windings, the temperature
in the gearbox bearings, hydraulic pressure, the pitch angle of each
rotor blade (for pitch controlled or active stall controlled machines),
the yaw angle (by counting the number of teeth on yaw wheel), the
number of power cable twists, wind direction, wind speed from the
anemometer, the size and frequency of vibrations in the nacelle and the
rotor blades, the thickness of the brake linings, whether the tower
door is open or closed (alarm system). <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Control Strategies</span> <br>
      <br>
Many of the business secrets of the
wind turbine manufacturers are to
be found in the way the controller interacts with the wind turbine
components. Improved control strategies are responsible for an
important part of the increase in wind turbine productivity in recent
years. An interesting strategy pursued
by some manufacturers is to adapt the operational strategy to the local
wind climate. In this way it may e.g. be possible to minimise
uneconomic tear and wear on the machine during (rare) periods of rough
weather. <br>
