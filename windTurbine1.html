mounted at the end of the rotor, which is hidden inside the shining
magnetic steel cylinder, called the stator. The radiator-like surface
cools the generator. It is hard to see the details on a real life
generator like the one to the right. Therefore, we'll take it apart and
make some simplified models on the next pages.</td>

Wind turbine generators are a bit unusual, compared to other generating
units you ordinarily find attached to the electrical grid. One reason
is that the generator has to work with a power source (the wind turbine
rotor) which supplies very fluctuating mechanical power (torque). </div>

            <div class="br1">
On large wind turbines (above 100-150 kW) the voltage (tension)
generated by the turbine is usually 690 V three-phase alternating
current (AC). The current is subsequently sent through a transformer
next to the wind turbine (or inside the tower) to raise the voltage to
somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000 volts, depending on the standard in
the local electrical grid. </div>

					
            <div class="br2"> Large manufacturers will supply
both 50 Hz wind turbine models (for the electrical grids in most of the
world) and 60 Hz models (for the electrical grid in America). </div>

            <div class="br1">
Generators need cooling while they work. On most turbines this is
accomplished by encapsulating the generator in a duct, using a large
fan for air cooling, but a few manufacturers use water cooled
generators. Water cooled generators may be built more compactly, which
also gives some electrical efficiency advantages, but they require a
radiator in the nacelle to get rid of the heat from the liquid cooling
system. </div>

						Starting and Stopping the Generator

            <div class="br1">
If you connected (or disconnected) a large wind turbine generator to
the grid by flicking an ordinary switch, you would be quite likely to
damage both the generator, the gearbox and the current in the grid in
the neighbourhood. </div>

            <div class="br1">
						 Wind turbines may be designed with either synchronous or asynchronous generators, and with various forms of direct or 
						<a href="http://www.windpower.org/en/tour/wtrb/indirect.htm">

            <div class="br2">
Indirect grid connection means that the current from the turbine passes
through a series of electric devices which adjust the current to match
that of the grid. With an asynchronous generator this occurs
automatically. </div>
